**Aquas-Lur** is a flooded [[Lucid Worlds|Lucid World]] that houses the [[Sources]] of [[Condensation]] and [[Flow]] and was originally inhabited by [[Aquas-Min]] and [[Terras-Min]]. These are two strikingly different [[Awakened Species]], which is also reflected on their associated [[Sources]]:
- **[[Aquas-Min]]:** They include several species of intelligent penguins and are associated to the Source of [[Flow]].
- **[[Terras-Min]]:** They are humans and are associated to the Source of [[Condensation]].

Originally, when the planet was called **Lur**, the [[Aquas-Min]] lived in coasts and near water, and the [[Terras-Min]] occupied the inner land masses. However, there was a sudden flood that put in risk the lives of both [[Awakened Species]], but, in the end, the best fitted to live in water survived. From this point forward, this Lucid World was knows as Aquas-Lur by the inhabitants, to symbolize the new era they were facing—this time, alone. 

### The extinction of the [[Terras-Min]]
The cataclysmic event that led to the extinction of the [[Terras-Min]] is remembered as [[The World Melt]], and the consequences were devastating:

First, after the world was flooded, all survivors sailed towards the highest mountains on **Lur**, which allowed them to survive for long. There, they could witness the formation of the enormous whirlpools that reached the very bottom of the new ocean, where the [[Aquas-Min]] would eventually build their cities.

The [[Terras-Min]], on the other hand, suffered in the mountains for decades, as the already inhospitable terrain was being eroded by the strong oceanic currents of the world. They suffered, until all land was gone, with the only memory of it being the flat stone surfaces covered in water where once were mountains.

The [[Aquas-Min]], to avoid the extinction, lend their flippers to their aid, housing as many [[Terras-Min]] as their cities could, but they were not made to live in such cold and wet conditions.

In the end, all that is left of the [[Terras-Min]] is the presence of their transmuted ice, used often in [[Aquas-Min]] buildings for their ability to lock in place structures without the need for binders, like cement.

## Whirlpool Cities
In the current time, the [[Aquas-Min]] have made their cities on the ocean floor, inside the great whirlpools formed in [[The World Melt]]. There, the conditions were harsh, cold and wet, but—contrary to humans—the [[Aquas-Min]] were adapted to those conditions.
