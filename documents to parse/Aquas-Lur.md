>***Aquas-Lur**, the flooded [[Lucid Worlds|Lucid World]] that houses the [[Sources]] of [[Condensation]] and [[Flow]]. It is inhabited primarily by [[Aquas-Min]], but there are also humans, [[Terras-Min]], which have found a way to persist here. A planet worth studying, as it has stayed untouched by our Source for longer than many others*.

## Species of Aquas-Lur
In Aquas-Lur there are two species: the [[Aquas-Min]] and the [[Terras-Min]]. 
+ The [[Aquas-Min]] are like penguins. They are fit for swimming and diving, and they are way shorter than a human, a little above 1 meter high. They are connected to the source of [[Flow]], which marks their bodies with runes that look like intricate feather patterns, but shine when they use magic.
+ The [[Terras-Min]] are humans. They usually live on glacial structures or ships, and they are linked to the source of [[Condensation]].
## History
+ The destruction of Terras-Lur: the water erosion the ground sections of the planet. Before that, tsunamis were created to fight the humans. In the end, humanity remained in the poles, using Absorption to create solid ground in which to live.
