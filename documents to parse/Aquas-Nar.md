The Aquas-Nar is the crystalline gem incrusted in the chest of [[Aquas-Min]], from [[Aquas-Lur]]. This gem is key to their survival, as when it is crushed, the user dies. However, if it is intact, the individual will *flow* inside it when debilitated, letting it rest. When healed, the [[Aquas-Min]] *flow* outside the gem if there is space for them.

The aspect of the gem varies in several aspects between the [[Aquas-Min]]:
- **Size:** It is usually the size of a human fist, although it can be as small as a walnut.
- **Color:** Although the gem has certain transparency, a color can be appreciated from it. Furthermore, when using magic, the gem shines, making it more visible.
- **Geometry:** The gem is perfectly spherical on the outside, but a geometrical pattern is visible on the inside. The most common figure is a square, but it could be from triangular all the way to octagonal.

Finally, one of the key aspects that helped the [[Aquas-Min]] survive [[The World Melt]] is that their gems float, so they tend to be moved by currents into the whirlpool cities or get caught in nets from fishing boats.
