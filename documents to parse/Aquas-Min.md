#Species
The Aquas-Min are one of the [[Awakened Species]] from [[Aquas-Lur]] and are associated with the Source of [[Flow]]. They look like penguins, but have human-like intelligence, which made the connection with magic possible.

Another interesting aspect of the Aquas-Min, is that all of them have a crystalline gem incrusted in their chest—called [[Aquas-Nar|The Center]] or [[Aquas-Nar]] in ancient texts—, and it can be considered their weak point, as crushing it is the only way to kill one of them. Otherwise, when they are debilitated, they *flow* inside their gem, where they rest for an extended period of time.

## The Four Penguin Species
The Aquas-Min includes four species of intelligent penguins. To each of them, by tradition, a specific Manifestation is taught, although theoretically they could learn any of them:
- **[[Current Holding]]:** It allows the user to interact with water and its currents, and it is taught to [[Blue Fairy Penguins]]. With it, the Aquas-Min can push and hold the wall of the great whirlpools, allowing for city expansion.
- **[[Mind Drift]]:** It allows the user to make thoughts *flow* and control animals. It is taught to the [[Emperor Penguins]], and is specially useful when navigating through areas with depredators, like leopard seals and sharks, as they can be controlled.
- **[[Devouring]]:** It allows the user to extrapolate the ability of its gem, making non-magical objects *flow* inside its stomach to be regurgitated later. It is taught to the [[Macaroni Penguins]], and is a jack of all trades, as portable, weightless storage is always useful.
- **[[Mobility Enhancing]]:** It allows the user to manifest the *flow* as soundwaves and ground slipperiness. It is taught to [[Adelia Penguins]], which allows them for an enviable mobility, specially useful when exploring new terrain.
 
## Fashion
As in every intelligent civilization, a sense of fashion has flourished, although there is some utilitarianism in the way the Aquas-Min do it. 

To begin with, the Aquas-Min don't inherently need clothes to keep themselves warm—evolution took care of that—, but they need to distinguish themselves and indicate positions of wealth and power to visitors from other whirlpool cities. For this, the usual accessories they wear are hats, fake moustaches made from whale beards and piercing on their beaks, and, for more formal occasions, wigs, ties and monocles. Additionally, a new common practice is inking the feather around their [[Aquas-Nar|Center]], creating glyph-like patterns that last for several days.

Finally, [[The Sailors]] wear a distinctive killer-whale jacket with the symbol of their guild at the back. It is a sign of respect, as sailing, fishing, and exploring, are considered some of the most dangerous tasks in [[Aquas-Lur]], due to the depredators, icebergs and the strong currents.
