From studying [[Sources]] from young [[Lucid Worlds]]—the ones in which magic appeared recently—, it is concluded that in each Lucid World, each Source is associated to a specific [[Awakened Species]]—which usually includes similar species. 

As a corollary:
- If two Sources appear in two different [[Awakened Species]], then the two Sources will be different. This extends to any number of [[Awakened Species]].
- If the same species (humans, orcs, penguins...) inhabit different [[Lucid Worlds]], they may gain access to different [[Sources]].
- The same Source can manifest in different [[Awakened Species]] only if they are from different [[Lucid Worlds]].
