## Species of Ementis
The way locals name living beings is related to their [[Magic Systems|Magic System]]:
+ [[Lektarf]]: The term used to refer to humans. It is related to  [[Lekorion]], the original human Source.
+ [[Emtarf]]: The term for any plant-like being. It is clearly related to the source of [[Emorion]], and rumor has it that a more intelligent [[Emgar]] -- a kind of leader -- existed long ago.
+ [[Deimtarf]]: The term used to refer to the [[Lektarf]] deities. Several texts and stories state that their Source is [[Deitorium]], and they are also human in appearance.

This designations are ancient, originated from so long ago that most of the information has already faded. Because of that, they have changed, and today the terms used are [[Humans]]—when speaking of [[Lektarf]]—and [[Emgar]]. The [[Deitarf]] have gone extinct in Ementis.

The [[Emgar]] have undergone a similar transition, as they lost their leader long ago. It is believed that this event scared their minds, as there is no precedent of non-intelligent species gaining access to magic, and in this way it could be explained through heritage. Nowadays, they are treated as livestock and are grown from seeds.

Finally, the [[Deitarf]] presence is problematic. On the one hand, due to the [[Source Uniqueness]] theory, the [[Deitarf]] must be a different species from [[Lektarf]], because they have access to a different Source, but ancient depictions of them show otherwise. On the other hand, even though it is considered a species, the truth is they were only four individuals, as far as records go.

## About the Planet
Verentis is a planet full of forests and jungles that regrow at an accelerated rate. They are distributed in patches though, so it never occupies further terrain. However, attempts to cultivate these lands resulted in fields covered in the same plants previous to any terraforming, which feed on the seeds of the new ones. 

Focusing on the geographical aspects of Verentis, we find [[The Wall of Lights]], a barrier on the planet's equator. However, it is not made of stone but rather an enormous swarm of tiny, shining 'bugs' that absorb vital energy on contact. The locals know these creatures as [[Soulbreakers]], and they are deeply connected to the ancient [[Deitarf]] presence in this world.

Finally, [[Ementis]] also has a rich history to it, starting with the war between the [[Lektarf]], ruled by the [[Deitarf]], against the [[Emgar]].
