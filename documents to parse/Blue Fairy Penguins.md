Blue Fairy Penguins are one of the species that compose the [[Aquas-Min]]. They are linked to the Source of [[Flow]] and, by tradition, they are taught the Manifestation of [[Current Holding]].

They are small penguins—around 43 cm tall and 1.5 kg—, whose names start by either "Ping-" as is generally used, or by "Mag-", in honor of Magnolia, the Blue Fairy Penguin who devised the use of [[Current Holding]] to expand the cities—calculating the minimum points to push the whirlpool wall outwards safely.
