While [[Source Uniqueness]] explain the behavior of [[Sources]] for younger [[Lucid Worlds]], for the elder ones, there are records of individuals accessing the Source of a different [[Awakened Species]]. This is believed to be caused by exposing [[Awakened Species]] to different Sources for extended periods of time—millennia at the very least.

There is, however, an aspect of [[Source Uniqueness]] that is kept untouched and is the fact that a creature has only access to one Source—being that Source the one from your [[Awakened Species]] or a different one.

Additionally, despite the time needed for the first individual to access a different Source, from that point there is a cascade effect, by which some members of the same [[Awakened Species]] are born with the different Source, specially their descendants.

Finally, by the time a great amount of members of a certain [[Awakened Species]] have access to a different Source, new [[Manifestations]] form, connecting both [[Sources]].
