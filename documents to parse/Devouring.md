Devouring is one of the [[Manifestations]] of the Source of [[Flow]]. It allows for interaction with the *fundamental flow* of an object, working as an extension of [[Aquas-Nar|The Center]] for the [[Aquas-Min]].

**Passive:** Absorb a non-magical object, that fits in a 0.5 m cube. The object can be as far as 5 ft. from you, and you can regurgitate it with an action at any time in an unoccupied space up to 5 ft. from your current position.

**Heavy Digestion:** destroy one of the objects you absorbed and transform it into 1d4 ammunition.

**Puke:** spit an object or ammunition that is stored in your stomach. If aimed to a creature, make an ranged attack roll. 
- **Objects:** 1d4 damage, except for throwable weapons, such as darts and hand-axes (which keep their stats.)
- **Ammunition:** 1 Puncture damage, but can throw up to 3 in the same action. You can chose a new target for each shot.

**Gastric Coating:** You can fuse an object or up to 3 ammunition with your gastric fluids as an action. When you spit something covered in your gastric fluids, it deals +2 Acid damage.

**Flavor Memory:** You can lick a surface to discover if someone has touched it before. To know the identity of the creature, you must have licked it, or its clothes, before. You can follow trails with this ability.
