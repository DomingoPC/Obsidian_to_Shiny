Current Holding is one of [[Manifestations]] of the Source of [[Flow]]. It allows for water manipulation and its currents. However, they are not limited to environmental water, as they can infuse a certain amount of contained water to exert a stronger control over it.

---

**Passive:** Add 5 ft. to your swimming speed.

**Set-up:** Create a water wall or soak the floor in an area (only one of them can be active at a time). This ability can also be used to recover the spilled water into a container. As the water is under the user's control, it can be overlapped with other users' water without interfering.
- **Water wall**: up to 3 squares wide, 1 square deep and 2 squares high.
- **Soak the floor**: up to 3 square radius.
- **Contained water**: Store at least 20 L of water to perform the other actions without restrain. If environmental water is stored, it won't be of use until after a long rest.

**Currents Control:** Depending on the first ability cast, the effect changes:
- **If the water wall is deployed:** You can move it up to 3 squares in your turn, knocking down creatures in its path. If the creature succeeds a DEX saving throw, it stumbles and loses 10 ft. of movement. If the creature fails, it falls prone and loses half of its movement.
- **If the floor is soaked:** Convert the terrain into difficult terrain for 3 turns. If the terrain is already difficult, you can make it steady terrain for 2 turns (including other uses of this ability).

**Mineral water:** In a long rest, you can infuse your contained water with minerals, making it store 15 PG of healing that you can distribute between the creatures touching your water as an action—as long as you are also touching the water.

**Water String:** Create a water string connected to your flapper that can reach up to 15 ft. (3 squares). With it, you gain advantage in checks for opening locks and pickpocketing, you can also transport an object that is less than 4 kg, and you can set up basic traps—as long as the string is still connected to you.
