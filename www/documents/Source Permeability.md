Despite [[Source Uniqueness]] implications, after enough time has passed a creature may become permeable to a different Source, i.e., if the species A has access to the Source X and species B has access to the Source Y, after some time an individual from A may gain access to the Source Y, and vice versa. This, however, doesn't mean that a creature can access several [[Sources]], but that it can be born with one or the other.

As a summary, it can be said that every creature has a list of compatible [[Sources]]. One of them will be the Source corresponding to its species, but with time, another Source might be added to the list. Additionally, even though there is no way of changing one's Source into a different one from the list, your descendants inherit the choices.

For example, humans from [[Aquas-Lur]] have the Source of [[Condensation]], so John, a human, has [[Condensation]] in his list. By chance and naturally, John may gain access to the other Source in [[Aquas-Lur]], called [[Flow]] (maybe from exposure), but as he was born with [[Condensation]] there is nothing he can do to access [[Flow]]. However, after some time, his son Michael is born and, as John was permeable to both [[Condensation]] and [[Flow]], Michael could gain access to either [[Condensation]] or [[Flow]] (only one though).
