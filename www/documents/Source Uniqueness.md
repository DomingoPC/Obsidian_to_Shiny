There is a rule in Sources. Furthermore, this is not limited to intelligent individuals, as there are some registered cases of animal-like creatures. 

There are several implications to this:
+ Creatures of the same species in different planets, may gain access to different Sources.
+ Intelligent creatures may be better suited to obtain Sources, although the possibility of less-intelligent creatures not being capable of using it due to a lack of understanding cannot be discarded.
