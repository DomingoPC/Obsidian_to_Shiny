There is a rule in [[Sources|Source]] creation, which implies that, in the beginning, each of them is associated to a specific species of a particular [[Lucid Worlds|Lucid World]]. Furthermore, this is not limited to intelligent individuals, as there are some registered cases of animal-like creatures. 

There are several implications to this:
+ Creatures of the same species in different planets, may gain access to different [[Sources]].
+ Intelligent creatures may be better suited to obtain [[Sources]], although the possibility of less-intelligent creatures not being capable of using it due to a lack of understanding cannot be discarded.
