## Introduction
This website is a compendium of my tries at making Magic Systems, so it can be seen by my players to enrich the experience—e.g. one could be a magic expert, so this could help them role better. For the way to narrate my ideas, I was indecisive between an in-universe writer or myself (taking an outside point of view), so after some experimentation I decided on writing the info myself, while keeping some in-universe content showcased like this:

 >This is an example of in-universe narration.
 >
 >	From (some book name), by (someone). 		

To navigate through the information, there are several options:
- Firstly, many **words show as links**, and they will redirect you to the document with the same name. There are some examples of this later in this document.
- Secondly, there is the sidebar of the webpage. At the upmost position there is a **"Select Document"** menu and, at the bottom most position, there are some **documents tagged after some key categories**.
- Finally, in the middle section of the sidebar there is a button called **"Network Visualization"**. Clicking it will show the connections between all the documents and their tags. It is an interactable graph (you can even drag the nodes), so by clicking at one document and pushing the button "Go to Selected Document" at the top, the webpage will show you the document corresponding to the selected node.

## First System, then Magic
The approaches that I've enjoyed the most are the one shown in *Dungeons and Dragons* and in *Brandon Sanderson* fantasy books. In them, there is structure, internal laws and one can actually understand it to a certain extent, specially in the later, and I believe that those kind of systems help a lot when adapting them to a role game ruleset. This said, I'm still unsure if this is the place to show the actual rules that my players and I develop to play games in these worlds—it is basically tables of effects and die rolls that may kill a bit the ambience—, but I also see the beauty of keeping everything together, so maybe in the future.

One side effect of having a rule heavy system like this, is that you can basically write pages of anything, even the tiniest detail. The problem with this, of course, is that there is a lot of irrelevant information depending on why you are reading this, so I'll give you some tips on where the most relevant information for you might be:
+ **If you are a player:** then check the documents under the tag "Planets"—you can use the sidebar or the graph for that. Those act like the main pages for the specific systems and should contain all the information for the upcoming session, so you better read it (I'm watching you).
+ **If you just want to see the system:** then you may be interested in starting with one of the planets as well, like <a href='#' class='note-link' data-id='Aquas-Lur' onclick="Shiny.setInputValue('linked_doc_click', 'Aquas-Lur', {priority: 'event'}); return false;">Aquas-Lur</a>, or if you are interested in a more fundamental approach, check <a href='#' class='note-link' data-id='Magic Systems' onclick="Shiny.setInputValue('linked_doc_click', 'Magic Systems', {priority: 'event'}); return false;">Magic Systems</a>.
+ **If you are reading this because you are my friend and you love me:** I love you too <3.

## Final note
This is the first time that I'm writing my ideas in a more professional way, so I expect that with time I'll be able to express them better. Another thing that I expect to see are typos and grammar mistakes, but that is a consequence of refusing to use AI for my creative work.
