# Mind Drift
Mind Drift is one of the <a href='#' class='note-link' data-id='Manifestations' onclick="Shiny.setInputValue('linked_doc_click', 'Manifestations', {priority: 'event'}); return false;">Manifestations</a> of the Source of <a href='#' class='note-link' data-id='Flow' onclick="Shiny.setInputValue('linked_doc_click', 'Flow', {priority: 'event'}); return false;">Flow</a>. It allows the user to manipulate thoughts, either making them *flow* from the user's mind to another or altering its own.

---

**Passive:** You can feel creatures behind non-magical walls, which lets you have an estimate on the number of beings. To know the exact number of creatures, you have to succeed in an Intelligence check.

**Command Action:** You order a willing creature withing 30 ft. to take a specific action—move, dodge or any of their abilities for example. At the beginning of its turn, the creature can perform that action for free. After that, it can continue with its turn normally. The selected creature can be yourself.

**Forced Treason:** You influence over the mind of a creature within 10 ft. 
- If the selected creature fails an INT saving throw against your Spell Save DC (8 + INT mod.), then it attacks a creature of your choice that is within line of sight (which can be changed as a bonus action). 
- In a successful saving throw, the creature will be aware of your intentions.
- If the creature is wearing a magic-infused garment that covers its head, it has advantage on the saving throw.

**Command Lesser Beings:** You can ask creatures with few INT—e.g. seagulls—to perform simple actions. Your command can be up to three words long, but you may use gestures—like pointing—to make yourself understood.

**Self-Suggestion:** You influence your own thoughts to manipulate your behavior. By default, you have a +1 modifier to your Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation and Performance. However, you can have a +5 modifier instead if you successfully get "Heads" in a coin throw. 
If you get a "Tails", then one of the following effects appears for 10 minutes:

| D6 Roll | First Stage (rolled for the first time)          | Second Stage (rolled for the second time)        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | You hear everyone as if they were screaming      | You become deaf                                  |
| 2       | You walk with a limp                             | Lose legs mobility                               |
| 3       | Another player controls one of your arms         | A second player controls your other arm          |
| 4       | You can't talk without stuttering                | You can barely talk, due to uncontrollable cough |
| 5       | When talking to a person, you can't look at them | You become blind                                 |
| 6       | Shit yourself in 1d6 actions (secret roll by DM) | Too late                                         |

During the 10 minutes of the first effect, you can try a coin throw again. If you get "Heads", the +5 modifier will be applied, but the negative effects remain active until the 10 minutes pass. If you get "Tails", one of the following happens:
- **You roll a new effect:** You stack the new effect on top of the existing ones for the remaining time.
- **You roll an effect for the second time:** The effect evolves into its second stage.
- **You roll an effect for the third time:** independently of the effect, you faint for the rest of the duration.
