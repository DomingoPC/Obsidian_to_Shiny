>One of the species in Aquas-Lur. They are like penguins, except more intelligent, which made the connection with magic possible, in this case, with the source of Flow.

The Aquas-Min have several Manifestations available and, curiously, they seem to be segregated in species, which is purely cultural, as every penguin can actually learn any of them. Furthermore, the segregation leaks into their names too, having different prefixes. This said, with cultural mixture these rules have become lax, allowing for some Aquas-Min to learn a different manifestation, and to have a common prefix for any species, "Pin-".

## Manifestations



This is also reflected in their names

Also, all of them are born with a crystalline gem incrusted in their chests—called the Aquas-Nar or Center—, which grows with them, yet the color remains the same, and they shine whenever they are using magic.

The Aquas-Min are linked to the source of Flow, which allows them to interact with currents and movement in general. However, the race of the penguin determines how they manifest it and not only that, but also the prefix they use on their name by tradition—although names started in 'Pin-' are becoming more common in general by the day:

+ **Blue Fairy Penguins:** They are small penguins—around 43 cm tall and 1.5 kg—that can interact with water. Some uses of it is healing, creating walls of water and using a fine layer of water on the ground to make someone slip. Traditionally, their names start with 'Mag-'.

+ **Adelia Penguins:** They are average size penguins—around 70 cm tall and 4 kg—that can 'absorb' the movement surrounding them to speed up and even launching themselves into the air. And not only they have great mobility, they are also capable of building up a sonic attack in their beaks that can stumble enemies from afar. Traditionally, their names start with 'Fi-'.

+ **Macaroni Penguins:** They are average size penguins—around 70 cm tall and 5 kg—that can manipulate the currents inside their bodies, allowing them to strengthen themselves by improving their blood flow. Also, they are experts on regurgitating food, objects or gastric fluids inside their stomachs, as well as preserving objects in their stomachs untouched by acids. Traditionally, their names start with 'Ur-'.

+ **Emperor Penguins:** They are the biggest penguins—around 120 cm and 45 kg—, and they can infuse things with movement. To do this though, they need a source of movement to extract it from like incoming attacks—reducing the damage taken—or even their own movement. This way, not only are they able to redirect attacks or push enemies together, but also taking the hits. Traditionally, their names start with 'Cla-'.

## Fashion
The Aquas-Min don't inherently need clothes to keep themselves warm—evolution took care of that—, but as in all other civilizations, a sense of fashion starts to flourish to further distinguish themselves from others and to indicate wealth and power. However, the main different between "animal" penguins and them is their Center—an incrusted crystal in their chest, which shines when using magic on a specific color.

The usual accessories the Aquas-Min wear are hats, fake moustaches—made from whale beards—and piercings on their beaks. Additionally, there is the recently common practice in which they ink their feathers, making it look like a tattoo around their chest crystal. For more formal occasions and important people, the Aquas-Min prefer the use of wigs, ties (or bow-ties) and monocles. 

Finally, there is a distinctive garment for The Sailors—the Aquas-Min who connect the cities together by ship, and study the seas and their currents—, a killer whale jacket with a symbol printed on the back, matching their guild's.
