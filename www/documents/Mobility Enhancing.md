**Passive:** When you fall prone, you can choose to slide on your belly instead to keep your speed unchanged. As a result, only the following rules apply when you are prone:
- An attacker within 5 ft of you has advantage on attack rolls against you.
- An attacker further than 5 ft of you has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

**Ground Shake:** as an action, you can generate waves in the ground targeting a creature.
- **If you target yourself:** your speed increases 15 ft.
- **If you target another creature:** You make a ranged attack roll to hit a creature in a range of 30 ft of you. If you are successful, the creature receives 1d4 impact damage and a 5 ft speed reduction.

**Chained Thrust:** as a bonus action, you can go through one creature. This action doesn't trigger a reaction attack when leaving the target's range.
- As part of this skill, you can damage your target releasing part of your remaining speed inside them. The damage is truncated from the result of $\text{Damage} = \frac{1}{5}\cdot\text{(Spent Speed in ft)}$, to avoid decimal numbers.
- When leaving the target's body, you get launched 10 ft into a direction you chooseâ€”which is not added to your speed. If you hit another creature, you can freely use this skill again, otherwise, the collision just stops you, leaving you prone or standing.

**Sudden Impulse:** Whenever you are in contact with a creature, as an action you can make them roll a DEX saving throw against your spellcasting DC (8 + INT modifier). 
- If the **target fails**, it is pushed 10 ft into a direction you choose.
- If the **target succeeds**, nothing happens.
- If you are going throw the target as part of **Chained Thrust**, the target fails automatically.

**Ground pulse:** When you are in contact with a surface, you can feel the vibrations inside it. If you succeed in a Perception check, you can know the location of a creature by its steps.
- The target must be up to 60 ft of you.
- For very populated areas, like markets, you roll with disadvantage.
You can also send vibration pulses to creatures in range.
