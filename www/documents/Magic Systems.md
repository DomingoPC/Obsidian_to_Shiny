The basis of any **Magic System** are their [[Sources]], which could be understood as the fuel consumed in an incantation or spell.

These [[Sources]] are not the final effect themselves, and require [[Manifestations]] to channel the raw magic into spells.

## The recipe for magic
Magic is born from the combined effects of **life** and **gravity**. Because of that, one may find satellites, asteroids and most celestial bodies to be sterile ground. All except for planets in which life has flourished, which I will refer to as [[Lucid Worlds]]. 

In a [[Lucid Worlds|Lucid World]], [[Sources]] become accessible to the local life forms. However, although the norm indicates that there should only be one [[Sources|Source]] for a specific species, I have observed cases in which several of them can be accessed, if only one at a time.

Some examples of magical planets are:
+ [[Ementis]]: a world in which most of the animals are replaced with plant-like beings, except for the humans. There are rumors of plant-people coexisting too, but they might be extinct.
+ [[Aquas-Lur]]: a planet covered in water almost entirely, where Aquas-Min learnt to draw the power to control the currents, wind and water alike. ((I want to add absorption too -> humans are solidifying water in the poles to recover land)).

## Rules and Details
