# Magic Systems

Magic is an abstract concept used in many worlds to describe radically different phenomena, like influencing other creatures minds or enhancing your physical abilities. However, all of them share three common aspects: their origin, the fuel and the spells.

## The Origin
Every time has been observed, it was linked to the presence of both **life** and a **strong gravitational pull**. This essentially means that it appears in planets where life have flourished, although it is not instant, so the distinction between an **Asleep World** (with life, but no magic) and a **Lucid World** (with both life and magic) becomes relevant.

On this note, the small percentage of <a href='#' class='note-link' data-id='Lucid Worlds' onclick="Shiny.setInputValue('linked_doc_click', 'Lucid Worlds', {priority: 'event'}); return false;">Lucid Worlds</a> in relation to Asleep Worlds shows that the process is relatively rare, and the different levels of progress of the studied civilizations indicate that there is high variability in the time magic shows. 

## The Fuel and the Spells
The main distinction between the Magic Systems from different <a href='#' class='note-link' data-id='Lucid Worlds' onclick="Shiny.setInputValue('linked_doc_click', 'Lucid Worlds', {priority: 'event'}); return false;">Lucid Worlds</a> are the fuels needed to manifest magic, popularly known as <a href='#' class='note-link' data-id='Sources' onclick="Shiny.setInputValue('linked_doc_click', 'Sources', {priority: 'event'}); return false;">Sources</a>. These can be seen as the raw magic that allows to perform spells and incantations, and can take different forms: from surrounding movement to one's own vitality.

The way to channel <a href='#' class='note-link' data-id='Sources' onclick="Shiny.setInputValue('linked_doc_click', 'Sources', {priority: 'event'}); return false;">Sources</a> into tangible effects can be called spells, incantations, or even rules; but as a general concept, they are usually referred to as <a href='#' class='note-link' data-id='Manifestations' onclick="Shiny.setInputValue('linked_doc_click', 'Manifestations', {priority: 'event'}); return false;">Manifestations</a>. These are a broad concept, as each Source can have several <a href='#' class='note-link' data-id='Manifestations' onclick="Shiny.setInputValue('linked_doc_click', 'Manifestations', {priority: 'event'}); return false;">Manifestations</a>, and their effect have little to do with one another, except for the Source needed to cast them.
## Current Theories
Despite an understanding of the basics, more complex interactions are still being studied, with only a few theories offering some insight:
